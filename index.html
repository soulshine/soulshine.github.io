<p>Soulshine is a name I made to remind myself to stay true to my own self, and to contribute myself to that which serves others. </p>

<p>I am working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>An IRC successor; think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE">WASTE</a> but  it won't be broken, defunct and unscalable. More information will come as I make more progress with a proof-of-concept and alpha implementation.</li>
<li>A crawler/search engine built in Racket. Focus is on simplicity and fault-tolerance. Will probably be built around Riak, but I haven't really decided yet. (ROYAL COYOTE)</li>
<li>Lattice-based cryptography. Quantum computers threaten everything crypto has ever accomplished. It is absolutely essential that a complete crypto system be put in place. I have a few ideas for strong passphrase generation, but it won't matter if every cipher is broken from the beginning. It's not a problem of weak algorithms, but strong computers. I'm going to make the computers work against themselves.</li>
</ul><p>You can find my code <a href="www.github.com/soulshine">here on Github</a></p>
