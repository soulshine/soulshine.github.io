More information will come as I make more progress with a proof-of-concept and alpha implementation.\r\n* A crawler/search engine built in Racket. Focus is on simplicity and fault-tolerance. Will probably be built around Riak, but I haven't really decided yet. (ROYAL COYOTE)\r\n* Lattice-based cryptography. Quantum computers threaten everything crypto has ever accomplished. It is absolutely essential that a complete crypto system be put in place. I have a few ideas for strong passphrase generation, but it won't matter if every cipher is broken from the beginning. It's not a problem of weak algorithms, but strong computers. I'm going to make the computers work against themselves.\r\n\r\nYou can find my code [here on Github](www.github.com/soulshine)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
