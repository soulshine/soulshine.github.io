More information will come as I make more progress with a proof-of-concept and alpha implementation.\r\n* A modular roguelike mmo server/client hybrid that places total emphasis on strategy and fairness. Think SCII meets Dwarf Fortress, meets Final Fantasy, meets EVE Online, meets Minecraft. It'll be intense. \r\n\r\nI write Racket, although I have plans to learn Erlang and try to find an internship somewhere. \r\n\r\nYou can find my code [here on Github](www.github.com/soulshine)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
